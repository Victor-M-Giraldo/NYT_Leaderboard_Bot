# NYT_Leaderboard_Bot

A Discord bot that tracks scores from the New York Times Connections game and maintains monthly leaderboards across multiple servers.

## Features

- Users can directly paste their connections result and have it parsed by the bot and assigned a score based on performance.
- User scores are saved for a month.
- Users can type `!leaderboard` or use the `/leaderboard` slash command to see the leaderboard for the month.
- Server admins can set announcement channels with `/setannouncementchannel`.
- At the end of the month, the winner is declared along with the number of points.
- Previous months' leaderboards are stored in MongoDB.
- Support for multiple Discord servers.
